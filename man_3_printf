.TH NAME

_printf - formatted output conversion

.TH SYNOPSIS

include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);


.SH DESCRIPTION

The _printf function produces output according to a format which is described below. The function _printf writes output to stdout, the standard output stream. The handle_format function is a helper function used by _printf to handle specific format specifiers.

.SH _printf

int _printf(const char *format, ...);


.SH Parameters:


.SH format:


 A constant character string composed of zero or more directives. Ordinary characters (not %) are copied unchanged to the output stream; conversion specifications, each introduced by a % character, cause subsequent arguments to be converted and output according to the corresponding format specifier.


.SH Returns:


* The number of characters written, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings.

* Returns -1 if an error occurs.


.SH FORMAT SPECIFIERS


The format string may contain any of the following:


* %c: Writes a single character.

* %i: Writes a signed decimal integer.

* %d: Writes a signed decimal integer.

* %s: Writes a string of characters.

* %u: Writes an unsigned decimal integer.

* %o: Writes an unsigned octal integer.

* %x: Writes an unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase).

* %X: Writes an unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase).

* %p: Writes a pointer address.

* %%: Writes a literal % character.
