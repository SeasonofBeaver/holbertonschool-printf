# NAME

[_printf](https://github.com/SeasonofBeaver/holbertonschool-printf/blob/main/_printf.c) - formatted output conversion

## SYNOPSIS
```
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```

## DESCRIPTION

The [_printf](https://github.com/SeasonofBeaver/holbertonschool-printf/blob/main/_printf.c) function produces output according to a format which is described below. The function [_printf](https://github.com/SeasonofBeaver/holbertonschool-printf/blob/main/_printf.c) writes output to stdout, the standard output stream. The handle_format function is a helper function used by [_printf](https://github.com/SeasonofBeaver/holbertonschool-printf/blob/main/_printf.c) to handle specific format specifiers.

### _printf
```
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```

## Parameters:

### format:
 A constant character string composed of zero or more directives. Ordinary characters (not %) are copied unchanged to the output stream; conversion specifications, each introduced by a % character, cause subsequent arguments to be converted and output according to the corresponding format specifier.

### Returns:

* The number of characters written, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings.

* Returns -1 if an error occurs.

## FORMAT SPECIFIERS

The format string may contain any of the following:

* %c: Writes a single character.
* %i: Writes a signed decimal integer.
* %d: Writes a signed decimal integer.
* %s: Writes a string of characters.
* %u: Writes an unsigned decimal integer.
* %o: Writes an unsigned octal integer.
* %x: Writes an unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase).
* %X: Writes an unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase).
* %p: Writes a pointer address.
* %%: Writes a literal % character.
